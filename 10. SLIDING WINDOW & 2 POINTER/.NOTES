SLIDING WINDOW TECHNIQUE 
used for linear data structures (like arrays or strings) where you need to process a subrange (or “window”) to solve problems efficiently 
in O(n) time instead of using nested loops (O(n²))

TYPES OF SLIDING WINDOW

1. Fixed-size Sliding Window
Used when the window size is constant

- Max/Min/Average of all subarrays of size k
- Max sum of subarray of size k
- First negative number in every window of size k

2. Variable-size Sliding Window
Used when the window size changes based on a condition 

- Longest or shortest subarray that meets some constraint
- Substrings with/without repeating characters
- Anagram patterns, window sums, or unique characters
