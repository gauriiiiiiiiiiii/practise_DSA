/*
Given a sorted array arr of size n, containing integer positions of n gas stations on the X-axis
Integer k, place k new gas stations on the X-axis
The new gas stations can be placed anywhere on the non-negative side of the X-axis, including non-integer positions
Let dist be the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations after adding the k new gas stations
Find the minimum value of dist
